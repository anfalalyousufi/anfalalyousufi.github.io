	<h4> Who am I and why I blog? </h4>
	<p> Blogs are everywhere—blogs about pets, food, cars and even blogs about blogs. Data science is no exception.

	<p>Hello everyone! My name is Anfal Alyousufi and I am a Data Scientist at PhazeRo.

	In this first blog I wanted to take the opportunity to tell you all a little bit about me as well as outline what I hope to achieve through this weekly/bi-weekly blog.</p>

	<h4> So, who am I? </h4>
	<p> My name is Anfal, and I am currently based in Muscat-Oman. I graduated from the University of South Florida in December 2019 with B.S and an MS degree in Computer engineering. I have always been that person who is looking for challenges where I can apply my technical skills.
	<p> During school, I worked as a research assistant for two research labs in Florida. I also belonged to a few organizations, including The Mechanical Electrical Computer Hub and The Society of Women Engineers. </p>

	<h4> Blogs? </h4>
	<p> I am planning on posting at least one blog a week. These would be a way for sharing tips, hints, opinions, and tools that might help the industry in any way (from my perspective and some solid studies). Like many others, I have learned a lot from making mistakes and studying hard, and learning from a few experts along the way. If sharing these thoughts and tips would help prevent even one person from making the same mistakes, then it has been worth my while! 

	<p> My goal is to cover a huge range of topics in the data science field but please, feel free to comment below or drop me a message with any topics you would like me to cover, and I will be back with some amazing content for you all!</p>

	<p>Until next time, happy blogging, and God bless.

	<h4> What is data science to Anfal? </h4>
	<p> Data Science is about using data to create as much impact as possible for a company. Impacts can be in the form of multiple things; it could be insights, data production, or product recommendations for a company. Tools are needed to accomplish this, such as building models, creating data visualizations, or writing code. But essentially, as a data scientist, someone’s job is to solve real company problems using data while the type of tools used is not important. Hence, in other words, data science is using data to improve products.</p>

	<h4> Hence, who is a Data Scientist and what is Data Science? </h4>
	<p>According to <a href ="https://www.mastersindatascience.org">mastersindatascience.org</a>, the data science role is a combination of mathematics, statistics, and computer science. They analyze data and create models that explain that data, interpreting results to create actionable companies' actionable plans. Their typical work involves making sense of unstructured data from sources that don't neatly fit into a database.</p>


	<h4> Not to be confused between Data Science and Computer Science? </h4>
	<p> In general, the Data Science core job is a bit more abstract as it revolves around attempting to improve a process or answer an unknown. That is by being able to extract huge amounts of data from multiple resources and then analyze it. In contrast, the computer science role revolves around building and modifying into deeper work of software applications.</p>

	<p> So, typically computer science duties include optimizing and building code and testing, documenting, and debugging code. Whereas data science major duty would include building data models and collecting, cleaning, and organizing data sets. </p>

	<h4> How is leading a data science team different? </h4>
	<p> Based on my opinion, one of the interesting things about leading analytics data science functions that could be different than some other types of management functions is that leaders, as they continue to gain responsibilities and rise, will often stay very engaged in the core research and the linework of the team. Giving an example, it would be unusual at a large bank for a very senior manager to still be evaluating loan applications. While in fact, a data science team leader will often continue to do research and continue to do the very work that they started doing when they first started their work in data science. </p>

	<h4> Data Science environment </h4>
	<p> Hence data science requires a different environment for the team in a data science type function. One of the important things to be in any work environment is that colleagues should feel very free to exchange ideas and be given credit for the work they do. Hence, knowing credits would be given and not worry about your work not being recognized will help the work get better, knowing that their insights are being valued. This is a very key thing that I think leaders have to instill culturally within the group. </p>

	<h4> A leader should see one's important </h4>
	<p> Another important thing is the one-to-one type management issue, but also the type of resources the team has been is important. The leader should be able to see his teams' function to ensure that the team has whatever it needs to be successful. Hence, that is more important than how many think of more of pedestrian things, such as if there are enough spaces and if there are enough people in the team, which in my opinion is not as important as knowing they have access to the dataset that is needed and so on.  Another important thing is that the leader works to make sure the team has access within the organization to the organization's people that are critical for the problems they are working on. This could include understanding the problems well, which will help make decisions about how to deploy the research or anything of an effect which could also include people outside the department or company and academics that have researched as it is vital to have an academic channel through which you can test out ideas and other new ideas. </p>

	<h4> Another important thing in a research leader </h4>
	<p> I think that the good research manager will work very hard to stay out of the way, and that sounds contradicting to the points given earlier about leaders, as I said, should get their hands dirty. Still, I think those are two sides of the same coin, as a manager will continue to do the work, but they will do it in a very strategic way that is helpful to their colleagues and teams in the same way as any other member of the team will; sometimes leading research and other times helping out. It will be essential that the colleagues who are in charge of a specific research problem be given the freedom to solve that problem in the way they think is the appropriate way. </p>


	<h4> Mature ways to solving a problem </h4>
	<p> There are very often many ways to solve problems, and mature data analytics people will understand the trade-offs that should be made in those situations given the constraints as long as these constraints are met and the trade-offs are made in an organizationally acceptable way. Every individual should be allowed to pursue their research in the way they think it should go while having the team leaders provide a little oversight or maybe sometimes steering it from time to time, but mainly and largely staying out of the way.</p>
	<p>For those reasons, someone would know it can be slightly different for leaders who often think of their job as top-down control to think about a data analytics group. Still, it is often the case that the very best data science leader comes from the data science and analytics field. It is good news because it means they don't have to give up those things that they really enjoy doing and what brought them to the field in the first place to become a leader and have greater influence within the organization.</p>

	<h4> What is the best way to lead data science?</h4>
	<p> Data science is science, it is still a hybrid of academic culture and a business culture as it is transforming data into value. Data could be a business data that is transformed into assetss to help organizations seize business opportunities, improve revenue and customer supports, reduce costs, and more by the method of gleaning insights from both structured and unstructured data approached ranging from statistical analysis to machine learning. 
	If culture is not set right, you cannot execute the strategy that you are thinking of. </p>
	<p>Leading Data Science would depend on the company's size and their business objectives, it could be considered as a supporting department and then many companies have data science operating on their engineering, but their business objectives would be more short term. Data science operations now are led by domain experts that really have done data science, written code, and they are now leading the data science operations by example, this is why we have all sorts of titles floating around.</p>

	<h4> What is the best way to lead data science (needs review)? </h4>
	<p> Data science is science, it is still a hybrid of academic culture and a business culture. If culture is not set right, you cannot execute the strategy that you are thinking of.</p>
	<p> Leading Data Science would depend on its size and business objectives. It could be considered a supporting department, and then many companies have data science operating on their engineering. Still, their business objectives would be more short term. Data science operations are now led by domain experts who have done data science and written code. They are now leading data science operations by example, which is why we have all sorts of titles floating around.</p>

	<h4> Data Science goals </h4>
	<p> Data science needs to be aligned with the organization's goal, as there are two extremes when it comes to building a data science strategy. One extreme is the academic mindset, where someone would research long-term impact, and the other extreme is the short-term pragmatism that comes with short-term deliverables in the business setting. Therefore, in data science operations, the balance has to be set right to align with any company/organization's business objectives. </p>


	<h4> Deliverables </h4>
	<p> There are larger companies, such as Google and Facebook, which have the resources to make mid-term and long-term investments only as they have research teams that really would operate like academic institutions as most companies don’t have those resources don't have those objectives. Hence, any leader who is coming in has to first and foremost identify the business objectives and what sort of short-term, mid-term, and long-term deliverables they can deliver to the board to justify the operation’s existence. This is very important. </p>

	<h4> Conclusion </h4>
	<p> In summary, a smart leader would focus on delivering the short term and invest in the long term. </p>
